You are in a laravel app project folder
I am using nonly blade (no inertia)
I want you to:
- write the ui for a bunch of pages and partials for my auth related stuff located in "/resources/views/auth".
For that, you need to check the auth related routes in "/routes/mainRoutes.php",
make sure to uses the pre-written ui components in "/resources/views/components/ui" whenever possible for consistent style,
the controller responsible for auth related stuff is "AuthController", refer to the routes for more info about each action,
the project is using tailwindcss, there are also predefined colors in "/resources/css/app.css",
there are some comments in each page and partial in "/resources/views/auth" to help you,
before start writing the ui for each page and partial, tell me what you've understood, and what your're gonna do next
