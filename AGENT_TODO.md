You are in a laravel app project folder
I am using only blade (no inertia)
I want you to implement the pages "/views/customer/page.bookings_list" and "/views/customer/page/profile".
For that , you need to first know all the available ui components you can use for consistent UI, check them in "/components/ui/".
You also need to check the controller responsible for passing data and rendering view for the pages we want to implement, the controller is "CustomerController.php".
You also can check the routes in "/routes/mainRoutes" especially the routes under the name "customer.".
Make sure the ui is clean and consistent.
Once that done, you will print what you have understood from these requirements, then write how you will approach the implementation.
Then start implmenting them.
